# Euclidean Distance Calculator

This project calculates the Euclidean distance between multiple 2D points. The Euclidean distance formula is:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

## Features
- Uses a Python function to compute distances.
- Iterates through a list of points to calculate all possible distances.
- Finds and prints the minimum Euclidean distance.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or copy the `euclidean_distance.py` file.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. The program will output the shortest Euclidean distance among the given points.
